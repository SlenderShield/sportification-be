### 2. Create a Venue (Required First)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/venues \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Downtown Sports Arena",

    },
    "operatingHours": {
      "monday": { "open": "09:00", "close": "22:00" },
      "tuesday": { "open": "09:00", "close": "22:00" }
    }
  }'
```

### 3. Check Availability

  -d '{
    "venueId": "YOUR_VENUE_ID",
    "startTime": "2025-10-15T14:00:00Z",
    "endTime": "2025-10-15T16:00:00Z"
  }'
```

### 4. Create a Booking

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/venues/bookings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "venueId": "YOUR_VENUE_ID",
    "startTime": "2025-10-15T18:00:00Z",

    "bookingType": "hourly",
    "participants": 6,
    "promoCodes": ["SAVE10"]
  }'
```

### 5. View Your Bookings

  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### 6. Venue Owner Dashboard

```bash
# Get analytics
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/venues/bookings/venue/YOUR_VENUE_ID/analytics \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Get calendar view
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/venues/bookings/venue/YOUR_VENUE_ID/calendar?startDate=2025-10-01&endDate=2025-10-31" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

## Creating Promo Codes

You can create promo codes directly in MongoDB:

```javascript
// Connect to MongoDB
use sportification

// Create a promo code
db.promocodes.insertOne({
  code: "SAVE10",
  description: "10% off all bookings",
  discountType: "percentage",
  discountValue: 10,
  validFrom: new Date("2025-01-01"),
  validUntil: new Date("2025-12-31"),
  usageLimit: 1000,
  usedCount: 0,
  applicableVenues: [],  // Empty = applies to all venues
  isActive: true,
  createdBy: ObjectId("YOUR_ADMIN_USER_ID"),
  createdAt: new Date(),
  updatedAt: new Date()
})
```

## Testing the Flow

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "startTime": "2025-10-15T19:00:00Z",
    "endTime": "2025-10-15T21:00:00Z",

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Email not sending

**Solution**: Check email configuration in `.env` file. For Gmail:

1. Enable 2-factor authentication
2. Generate app-specific password
3. Use that password in `EMAIL_PASS`

### Issue: Booking conflict not detected

**Solution**: Ensure MongoDB indexes are created:

```bash
npm run dev  # Indexes are created automatically on startup
```

### Issue: Promo code not working

**Check**:

- Code is active: `isActive: true`
- Current date is within validity period
- Usage limit not exceeded
- Minimum booking amount met

### Issue: Refund amount is 0

**Reason**: Cancellation is less than 12 hours before booking start time (no refund policy).

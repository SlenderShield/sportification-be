## 📝 Notes

### **Architectural Alignment**

All recommended features align with the existing **modular monolith** architecture:

- Each major feature = New module (e.g., `payments`, `media`, `gamification`)
- Event-driven communication with EventBus
- Clean architecture layers (API → Domain → Data → Events)
- Microservices-ready (can extract later)

### **Migration Path**

The current system is already well-positioned for adding these features due to:

- ✅ Clean module boundaries
- ✅ Event-driven architecture
- ✅ Strong authentication/authorization
- ✅ Comprehensive testing infrastructure
- ✅ Docker containerization
- ✅ Scalable database design

### **Resource Planning**

**Development Team Recommendations**:

- **Backend**: 2 developers (full-time)
- **Frontend**: 2 developers (if building client)
- **DevOps**: 1 engineer (part-time for infrastructure)
- **QA**: 1 tester (part-time)

**Timeline for MVP of All Priority 1 Features**: 4-6 months
